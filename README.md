# docker-wrap-image-with-senzing-apt

If you are beginning your journey with [Senzing],
please start with [Senzing Quick Start guides].

You are in the [Senzing Garage] where projects are "tinkered" on.
Although this GitHub repository may help you understand an approach to using Senzing,
it's not considered to be "production ready" and is not considered to be part of the Senzing product.
Heck, it may not even be appropriate for your application of Senzing!

## Overview

This repository shows how to [baked-in]
a Senzing installation into a Debian/Ubuntu based docker image.

## EULA

To use the Senzing code, you must agree to the End User License Agreement (EULA).

1. :warning: This step is intentionally tricky and not simply copy/paste.
   This ensures that you make a conscious effort to accept the EULA.
   Example:

   <code>export SENZING_ACCEPT_EULA="&lt;the value from [this link]&gt;"</code>

## Environment variables

1. :pencil2: Identify the existing image to be wrapped.
   Example:

   ```console
   export BASE_IMAGE="senzing/senzing-api-server:3.0.0"
   ```

1. :pencil2: Name the new image that will be produced.
   Example:

   ```console
   export NEW_IMAGE="mycompany/senzing-api-server:3.0.0"
   ```

## Build Docker image

1. Run the `docker build` command.
   Example:

   ```console
   docker build \
       --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=${BASE_IMAGE} \
       --build-arg SENZING_ACCEPT_EULA=${SENZING_ACCEPT_EULA} \
       --tag ${NEW_IMAGE} \
